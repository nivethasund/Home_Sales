# Home_Sales
## Module 22 Challenge Files

In this challenge, I use my knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. I have also used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

No sources were used beyond what was shared during the module.
